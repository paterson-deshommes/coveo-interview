# Review Challenge

This challenge is about reviewing code. We’ve built a solution to our normal [backend challenge](https://github.com/coveo/backend-coding-challenge), and we want you to review it. To make things clear, you don't have to prepare any code nor follow the README on GitHub. The GitHub link is only given to explain what the project in this archive accomplishes. The code to review is in this archive (see instructions below to run it). To add some complexity, we included both a UI on top of the backend project.

All steps listed below will be required during the interview. We expect you to do them BEFORE we meet.

- Make sure you can run the code (backend and frontend) and understand what's going on.
- Review the code and take notes on improvements or changes. Assume this code is in production right now, and plan changes for the next few releases. With an agile process in mind, note what to address in the first release, second release, etc. This will help us focus our discussion on priorities.
- Set up an environment where you can hit breakpoints and debug relevant parts of the code (backend, frontend, or both for full-stack). Use any application you prefer, but ensure you're comfortable debugging before the interview.
- Have an editor or IDE ready to code during the interview.
- Have Git installed.
- Make sure you understand the project thoroughly.

We didn’t follow our normal standards, so you should have some observations about the code.

Regardless of whether you’re a backend, frontend, or full-stack developer, we expect you to understand the project at a high level and form an opinion on it. If you’re applying for a backend role, we don’t expect as much frontend expertise, and vice versa. We’ll adjust focus based on the targeted position.

## Running the Backend
