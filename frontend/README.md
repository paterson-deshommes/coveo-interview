# Quick Start

The frontend is built using TypeScript and React. You will need Node.js installed. To run it:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the application with `npm run start`.

This will open a browser tab where you can search cities. Ensure the backend is running first; otherwise, the search feature will not work.
